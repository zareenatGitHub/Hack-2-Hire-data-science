# Hack-2-Hire-data-science
This repository houses a comprehensive implementation of a state-of-the-art question-answering model trained on the Quora Question Answer Dataset. The objective is to develop an AI system capable of accurately responding to a wide range of user queries, simulating human-like interactions.

# Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Thorough data cleaning, tokenization, and preprocessing techniques to prepare the Quora dataset for model training.
Model Architecture: Implementation of a BERT-based question-answering model for effective question understanding and answer generation.
Model Training: Detailed training process, including hyperparameter tuning and optimization for optimal performance.
Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation using metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and F1-score to assess model accuracy.
Visualization: Data exploration and model performance visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Libraries Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
PyTorch: Deep learning framework for model development and training.
Transformers: For working with pre-trained BERT models and tokenization.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
# Structure:

data: Contains the preprocessed Quora dataset.
models: Stores the trained BERT model and its configurations.
src: Contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
notebooks: Colab notebooks for exploratory data analysis and interactive visualizations.
